Developed by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/), the [frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) [standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) are a set of patterns for describing data, including datasets (Data Package), files (Data Resource), and tables (Table Schema). A Data Package is a simple container format used to describe and package a collection of data and metadata, including schemas. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard:

- [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
- [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an *exact* tabular file providing a path to the file and details like title, description, and others
- [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) = Data Resource + Table Schema
- [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the formatting specific to the various dialects of CSV files
- [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) & [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/): describes a *collection* of tabular files providing data resource information from above along with general information about the package itself, a license, authors, and other metadata
