`fr` provides `fr_tdr`, `fr_schema`, and `fr_field` objects for implementing
[frictionless](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io)
[tabular-data-resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource)
standards in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {fr} from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cole-brokamp/fr")
```

## Usage

- See `vignette("read_fr_tdr")` to read a Frictionless Tabular Data Resource from disk or the web, access metadata, and manipulate it as a data.frame
- See `vignette("creating_a_tabular-data-resource")` to create a Frictionless Tabular Data Resource by converting a data.frame or tibble, adding metadata, and writing to disk

## Frictionless Standards

Developed by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/), the [frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) [standards](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) are a set of patterns for describing data, including datasets (Data Package), files (Data Resource), and tables (Table Schema). A Data Package is a simple container format used to describe and package a collection of data and metadata, including schemas. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard:

- [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
- [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an *exact* tabular file providing a path to the file and details like title, description, and others
- [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) = Data Resource + Table Schema
- [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the formatting specific to the various dialects of CSV files
- [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) & [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/): describes a *collection* of tabular files providing data resource information from above along with general information about the package itself, a license, authors, and other metadata
